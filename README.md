# Design Thinking and Innovation

## Course description
Introduces concepts of design at a variety of scales and design disciplines. Participants will be exposed to core technologies and design concepts including design principles, processes, modes of thinking and analysis, prototyping skills and social aspects of design. The subject introduces essential skills and mind-set of innovation, entrepreneurship, and methodologies in design including teamwork and workflow organisation, team building and leadership, written and oral communication, graphic and analytical representation, and fabrication techniques. Student teams formulate and complete design projects, setting and achieving milestones under a team of instructors composed of engineers and architects.

The theme for our year was interacting with light. With that in mind, we set off on a project that spanned the whole term. 

## Project Serenity

The design draws inspiration from Chinese architecture and there is a purposeful allusion to lanterns. Its strength lies in its aesthetics, the amalgamation of light and water present a breathtaking image at night. The design sets itself apart by allowing the user to see silhouettes of fish as they move through the space. 

### Project Abstract
The double diamond framework formed the backdrop of our design process. Studying about user behaviour in the schoolâ€™s hostel area provided insight into which spaces were underutilised and we were able to provide focused solutions to user needs. We identified that fishes attract people to the pond in the day. Providing a more interactive and aesthetic way of watching the fishes would culminate in a 33% increase in footfall into the space. 

### Interaction
There are 8 copies of the installation to be put in the SUTD pond. An installation would brighten when the user walks closer to it. The fishes are able to swim up into the tank. When they do, their silhouettes would be cast on the screens of the installation. The silhouettes are dynamic in the sense that the movements of fishes are random. The user is presented with a different image every moment. 

### Creative Challenge 

The hardest part of this activity is to figure out how to integrate our pond into the pond non-intrusively. This means it must not have negative consequences to the environment or clash with architecture of the pond. Therefore, we decided to create a lantern with similar roof shape and textures to Jackie Chan Pavilion. Also, our lanterns do not excessively stress out the fishes with our standby mode, which pulsates at around 15% brightness.
